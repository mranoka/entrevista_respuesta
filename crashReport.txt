The Mini121519-01.dmp required the use of the WinDbg windows debugging tool for dump files. Upon analysis of the .dmp file in question, I can make several conclusions:

* The crash happened while running HiveMind.exe. 
* The target machine's operating system is not supported
* The module involved is Rtlh64 with IMAGE_NAME: Rtlh64.sys and SYMBOL_NAME: Rtlh64+152d3
